    "# Metrics to consider\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The ratio `(#different products)/(total #reviews)`.** Ideally we would like to have several reviews per product, thus this should be high.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The similar products should be considered as alternatives for the buyers.** E.g. a hair lotion for dry hair would not replace a hair lotion for greasy hair though different shovels could be considered as possible alternative choices. Unfortunately this is hard to extract thus should be decided manually.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data skewness in favor of the ratings 1 and 5.** It would be easier to answer our questions when we have many 5's and 1's, thus this should be high.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The dataset should be loaded instantly.** In order to have short feedback loops - at least in the beginning - we need to pick datasets with small size. We can still consider the large data sets, as long as we use only a random sample of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Existing bibliography.** Data sets which have already been used by others are preferred since we can get benchmarks, exploaratory analysis data and notebook kernels we can reuse and extend."
